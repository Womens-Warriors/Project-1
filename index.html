    <div class="paragraph"> Abortion law changes can have a significant impact on women, as they can affect their ability to access safe and legal abortion services. In some cases, new laws may restrict or prohibit abortion altogether, which can force women to seek out unsafe and illegal procedures. This can lead to serious health risks and complications, and in some cases, even death. On the other hand, changes that expand access to safe and legal abortion services can have a positive impact on women's health and well-being. This includes laws that remove barriers to accessing abortion care, such as waiting periods or mandatory counseling, as well as laws that allow for abortion in cases of rape, incest, or fetal abnormalities. </div>

            <li>
                In January 2021, the state of New York in the United States passed the "Reproductive Health Act," which removed several restrictions on abortion, including requirements that abortions be performed only by licensed physicians and bans on abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy except in cases of life-threatening circumstances.</li>
            <li> In March 2021, the state of South Australia in Australia passed a law decriminalizing abortion and allowing women to access abortion services without fear of prosecution.</li>
            <li> In 2019, the government of Ireland legalized abortion, overturning a longstanding ban on abortion in the country. This allowed women to access safe and legal abortion services in their own country, rather than being forced to travel to other countries to receive care.</li>
            <li> In 2018, the government of Argentina legalized abortion in cases of rape, risk to the mother's life, and fetal abnormalities. This helped ensure that women in Argentina have access to safe and legal abortion services, rather than being forced to seek out unsafe and illegal procedures.</li>
            <li> In 2017, the government of Chile legalized abortion in cases of rape, risk to the mother's life, and fetal abnormalities. This was a major change in a country that previously had some of the strictest abortion laws in the world. </li>
